# Crypto Price Tracker

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my implementation of a cryptocurrency price tracker built with React and Redux Toolkit. It was created as part of an assignment to demonstrate real-time data handling and state management.

## What's Inside?

I've built a responsive table that displays 5 major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, USDT, XRP, and BNB) with their key metrics. The app simulates real-time price updates to give you that live trading feel, even though we're working with mock data.

### Key Features I Implemented:

- ðŸŽ¨ A clean, responsive table layout that works well on different screen sizes
- ðŸ”„ Simulated real-time updates using a custom WebSocket simulator class
- ðŸ“Š Basic chart visualization for 7-day price trends
- ðŸŽ¯ Color-coded percentage changes (green for gains, red for losses)
- ðŸ’¾ All state managed through Redux Toolkit

## Tech Stack

I used:
- React 18 for the UI
- TypeScript for type safety
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Styled Components for styling
- Vite for the build tool

## How It Works

### The Table
I've implemented a table that shows:
- Basic info (logo, name, symbol)
- Current price
- Percentage changes (1h, 24h, 7d)
- Market data (cap, volume, supply)
- A simple chart showing price trends

### The Magic Behind Updates
Instead of using a real WebSocket connection, I created a `WebSocketSimulator` class that:
- Uses `setInterval` to update prices every 2 seconds
- Generates random price changes within realistic ranges
- Updates the Redux store with new values

### State Management
I used Redux Toolkit to:
- Store all crypto asset data
- Handle price updates through actions
- Optimize re-renders with selectors

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. To build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Project Structure

Here's how I organized the code:
- `/src/components` - React components (like the CryptoTable)
- `/src/store` - Redux store setup and slices
- `/src/services` - The WebSocket simulator
- `/src/types` - TypeScript interfaces

## A Quick Note

This is a learning project, so the price changes are randomly generated and don't reflect real market data. I focused on implementing the core requirements of the assignment while keeping the code clean and maintainable.
